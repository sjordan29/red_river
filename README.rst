Omo CMIP5 bias correction and downscaling
#########

Python and R code for bias correction and empirical-statistical downscaling of
CMIP5 projections for the Omo River Basin in Ethiopia.

The repository also includes code to calculate the zonal average precipitation and temperature for each subbasin in a SWAT model of the Omo River Basin and reformat the data into a SWAT-friendly input format.

Bias Correction Methods
=======================

We use a variation of the modified equidistant quantile matching (EDCDFm)
algorithm (`Li et al. 2010`_) of (`Pierce et al. 2015`_) to bias correct CMIP5
projections for the Omo River Basin, Ethiopia. Details of the Red River variation of
EDCDFm are provided `here. <https://github.com/scrim-network/red_river/blob/master/docs/bias_correction_methods.ipynb>`_

=======================
Downscaling Methods
=======================

We use a variation of the constructed analogs method described by (`Pierce et al. 2014`_)
to downscale CMIP5 projections for the Omo River Basin, Ethiopia. Our modified method is
termed **Constructed Analogs with Single Anomaly Analog (CASAA)**. Details of the
Red River CASAA method are provided `here. <https://github.com/scrim-network/red_river/blob/master/docs/downscaling_methods.ipynb>`_
